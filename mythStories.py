Cost of wisdom: The story of god-king Odin and his sacrifices for spiritual growth.
Odin was the king of the Aesir tribe, simultaneously god of war and earth as well as god of sky, wisdom, poetry and magic. He was shamanic, a lover of ecstasy, and trance, and often ‘effeminate’, embarrassing the Viking warriors who preferred his masculine side. One of the most striking attributes of his appearance is his single, piercing eye. His other eye socket is empty — the eye it once held was sacrificed for wisdom. He gave it up so he could drink from the well of wisdom. On another occasion, Odin hung on the world-tree Yggdrasil for nine days and nights, receiving no form of nourishment from his companions, sacrificing himself to himself, so that in the end he perceived the runes, the magically-charged ancient Germanic alphabet that was held to contain many of the greatest secrets of existence.
Odin often appears as a leader of the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession of the dead through the winter sky. He rides a horse that has eight legs and travels with his raven and a wolf, who give him information about what is happening in every corner of the world.
From another name of Odin, Wotan, comes the name ‘Wednesday’, linked astrologically to the solid-liquid ambiguous Mercury, a planet that is somewhere in between the masculine Mars and the feminine Venus.'''

The spider trickster: When a spirit tried to capture all the world’s wisdom.
Anansi, in the form of spider, once decided to hoard the entire world’s wisdom in a pot for himself. When he succeeded, he attempted to hide the pot at the top of a tree where nobody could find it. He tied the pot in front of him and tried to climb the tree, but kept sliding and losing his grip. His son, who had followed him, suggested he tie the pot to his back so he could climb more easily. When Anansi tried to implement his son’s suggestion, the pot slipped and fell to the ground. The wisdom fell out and a sudden rainstorm washed it into the river and from there to the waters of the ocean, so that everyone in the world now owns a little bit of it.'''

Beauty contest that led to war: How feuding goddesses caused the Trojan War.
All the Olympian gods were invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis except Eris, the goddess of discord. Angry, Eris decided to teach the assembled Olympians a lesson. She threw amongst them a golden apple on which was engraved the words, ‘For the most beautiful.’ Three goddesses — Hera, goddess of household, Athena, goddess of skills, and Aphrodite, goddess of beauty — claimed the apple and fought over it. No god, not even Zeus, dared judge who of the three goddesses was the most beautiful, and hence worthy of the apple. Finally, the goddesses were told to go to Paris, prince of Troy, known for his understanding of female beauty and his fair judgements. The three goddesses presented themselves to Paris and tried to impress him with their beauty. When he could not decide, each tried to bribe him secretly. Hera promised to make him ruler of the greatest kingdom in the world. Athena promised to make him the most admired warrior in the world. Aphrodite promised him the hand of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world.
Paris accepted Aphrodite’s offer. He gave her the apple and with that, he and the land of Troy earned the enmity of Hera and Athena forever. Thus, the cause of the Trojan War was not so much human folly as it was the pettiness of the gods.'''

Underworld: Gang wars are older than you think.
There were two sisters who hated each other: Inanna who ruled the world, land of the living, and Ereshkigal who ruled the underworld, land of the dead. Inanna decided to visit the underworld. She told the gatekeeper of the underworld that she wanted to attend her brother-in-law’s funeral rites. But perhaps she actually wanted to conquer the underworld. Before she left, Inanna instructed her minister Ninshubur to plead with the gods Enlil, Nanna, and Enki to save her if anything went wrong, and dressed elaborately for the visit. Her garments, unsuitable for a funeral, along with her haughty behaviour, made the queen of the underworld suspicious.
Following Ereshkigal’s instructions, the gatekeeper told Inanna she could enter the first gate of the underworld, but she had to hand over a piece of clothing. She asked why and was told, ‘It is just the way of the Underworld’. She obliged.
Inanna passed through a total of seven gates, each time removing a piece of clothing or jewellery she had been wearing at the start of her journey. When she arrived in front of her sister, she was stark naked and vulnerable. Ereshkigal turned Inanna into a corpse and hung her on a hook.
Three days and three nights passed and Ninshubur, following instructions, went to Enlil, Nanna, and Enki’s temples and demanded they save the goddess of life, love and living. The first two gods refused, saying it was her own mess, but Enki was deeply troubled and agreed to help. He created two sexless figures (neither male nor female). He instructed them to appease Ereshkigal and, when she asked what they wanted, ask for Inanna’s corpse and sprinkle it with the food and water of life.
Things went as Enki said and the two sexless beings were able to revive Inanna. But Ereshkigal’s demons followed Inanna out of the underworld and said she wasn’t free to go until someone took her place. They first came upon Ninshubur and asked her to take Inanna’s place. Inanna refused, saying she had helped her as she had asked. They next came upon Dumuzi, Inanna’s husband. He was enjoying himself though his wife was supposedly still missing in the underworld. Inanna wasn’t happy and said the demons could take him. Dumuzi tried to escape his fate but a fly told Inanna and the demons where he was. It was then decreed that Dumuzi would spend half the year with Ereshkigal in the underworld, and the rest of the year with Inanna.'''

The first couple: When a lovelorn husband followed his wife to the land of the death.
The primal human couple, Izanagi, the man, and Izanami, the woman, were responsible for churning out islands from the sea which they populated with their children, the many deities who populate the Japanese countryside. Izanami died while bearing the fire-god and Izanagi was so distraught that he was determined to bring her back. So he went to Yomi, the shadowy land of death, to fetch his wife. Unfortunately, Izanami had eaten the food of Yomi and so could never return.
Izanagi lit a torch, desperate to see his wife. To his horror, he found that her once beautiful body had decayed and was covered with maggots. He ran out of the underworld in fear, chased by Izanami who missed her husband and wanted him to stay. Izanagi finally reached earth and covered the entrance of the underworld with a huge boulder. His angry wife yelled, “I will kill a thousand living creatures each day.” Izanagi yelled back, “Then I will create 1,500 new lives each day.” So the story ends in eternal separation and bitterness.'''

Original Sin: Of Adam, Eve, an apple and a slithery snake.
God created the world out of nothingness in six days and rested on the seventh day. He created the first man, Adam, in his own image, and the first woman, Eve, from Adam’s rib. He told Adam and Eve to enjoy the wonderful Garden of Eden, but not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. That was the Forbidden Fruit! Adam and Eve obeyed God, but the Devil, in the form of a serpent, enchanted Eve and got her to take a bite of the Forbidden Fruit. She then convinced Adam to eat it too. Suddenly, innocence was gone. The humans became aware of their nakedness and tried to cover themselves. God was disappointed with his creations and cast them out of Eden for this original sin, the first act of disobedience. He also decreed that woman would be answerable to man, and that the children of Adam and Eve — all of humanity — would pay for this sin.
Various schools of Jewish, Christian and Islamic thought disagree on details of this story. Jewish folklore describes the fruit as a pomegranate. Christian folklore describes it as an apple. In Arabic folklore, it is the banana, for they equated India with its silks and spices as the land of Eden.
While Original Sin is a key theme in Christian mythology, in Islamic mythology, Allah forgives Adam and Eve and there is no concept of original sin or carrying forward of sins to the next generation.'''

Creation: Why big brother is always right.
Maui was the fifth child of Taranga. Some say he was born dead, others say since he was born prematurely, he was said to be a carrier of bad luck. So his mother threw him into the sea, wrapped in a tress of hair from her top-knot.
Ocean spirits found the child, revived him, wrapped him in sea weed and gave him to the care of Rangi, the sky-father, who took the child to the celestial realms and nourished him to adolescence.
One day Maui found the hair of his mother and, recognising it, decided to descend from the celestial world of his foster father and search for her in the world of humans. But he was always out of place both in the world of his mother, Taranga, and in the realm of his adoptive father, Rangi. Maui realised the days on earth are too short to get the work done. With the help of his brothers, he caught the sun in a noose and beat him severely with a jaw-bone club until he promised to go slower in future.
Maui then hauled up a great island that lurked below the sea in the form of a fish, using blood from his nose as bait. When it emerged from the water, Maui went to find a priest to perform the appropriate ceremonies and prayers, leaving his brothers in charge of the fish. They did not wait for Maui to return and began to cut up the fish, which immediately began to writhe in agony, causing it to break up into mountains, cliffs, and valleys. If the brothers had listened to Maui, the island would have been a level plain and people would have been able to travel with ease on its surface.'''

The true heir: An ancient tale of sibling jealousy and betrayal.
In the beginning there was nothing but waters of Nu in the world from which emerged the first pyramid-like mound, just like the earth that appears when the waters of the Nile recede. On this mound stood Atum who produced the god of air Shu and the goddess of moisture Tefnut, who in turn produced Geb, the earth-god, and Nut, the sky-goddess, who produced Isis and Osiris, the first queen and king of human civilisation. Atum is sometimes described as masculine, for he masturbates to create his male and female children. But he is also referred to as ‘the Great He-She’, acknowledging the androgynous nature of life before the arrival of the two genders.
Osiris became first king of the Nile valley and he established a great kingdom, but his brother, lord of the desert, became jealous of him and invited him to a meal and then showed him a box. ‘Is the box smaller or bigger than you?’ Seth asked innocently. Osiris was not sure, so Seth asked him to lie in the box and check. Osiris got into the box without suspecting a thing. Seth immediately sealed the box and buried Osiris alive. He then cut his body into tiny pieces and threw them in the Nile.
Isis searched the lands for various parts of her husband, and put them together. She then used her magic powers to resurrect her husband long enough to give her a child and this child was named Horus who was Osiris’ true heir. But Horus had to fight many battles to establish his supremacy over Seth.'''

One fateful day, a sea bird promised to take her away to his “comfortable, luxurious” home.

Fearing for his own safety, Sedna’s father threw her into the ocean to appease the angry birds. When Sedna tried to climb back into the boat, he cut off her fingers. As she struggled to use her mutilated hands to try again, he cut off her hands and threw her and her appendages into the water.

Killing the mother: When generations went blood-thirsty in a bid to create the earth, sky and humankind.
Tiamat was the great mother of all gods; in her body resided all her children. All was well until the children made so much noise that the old gods demanded the destruction of the new gods. The first time this happened, Tiamat warned her children. The second time this happened, Tiamat ordered her consort to destroy the new gods. The new gods rallied around Marduk who, after a furious fight, defeated Tiamat and her consort and all the old gods who sided with them. From the body of Tiamat, Marduk created the earth below and the sky above. Tiamat’s tears became the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. The blood of her consort was mixed with the red earth and from this was created humankind. As the spawn of the old gods, humanity was forced to serve the new gods forever. Failure to serve the new gods led to floods and storms. This tale is told in the Enuma Elish.'''

भगवान श्रीरामचन्द्र जब समुद्र पर सेतु बांध रहे थे, तब विघ्न-विचारणार्थ पहले उन्होंने गणेशजी की स्थापना कर नवग्रहों की नौ प्रतिमाएं नल के हाथों स्थापित कराईं। तत्पश्चात उनका विचार सागर-संयोग पर एक अपने नाम से शिवलिंग स्थापित कराने का हुआ। इसके लिए हनुमानजी को बुलाकर कहा “मुहूर्त के भीतर काशी जाकर भगवान शंकर से लिंग मांगकर लाओ। पर देखना, मुहूर्त न टलने पाए।” 
हनुमानजी क्षणभर में वाराणसी पहुंच गए। भगवान शंकर ने कहा- “मैं पहले ही दक्षिण जाने के विचार में था, क्योंकि अगस्त्यजी विन्ध्याचल को नीचा करने के लिए यहां से चले तो गए, पर उन्हें मेरे वियोग का बड़ा कष्ट है । वे अभी भी मेरी प्रतीक्षा कर रहे हैं । एक तो श्रीराम के तथा दुसरा अपने नाम पर स्थापित करने के लिए इन दो लिंगों को ले चलो।” 
इस पर हनुमानजी को अपनी महत्ता तथा तीव्र गामिता का थोड़ा-सा गर्वाभास हो आया। 
इधर, कृपा सिन्धु भगवान को अपने भक्त की इस रोगोत्पत्ति की बात मालूम हो गई। उन्होंने सुग्रीवादि को बुलाया और कहा-“अब मुहूर्त बीतना ही चाहता है, अतएव मैं सैकत (बालुकामय) लिंग की ही स्थापना किए देता हूं।” 
यों कहकर मुनियों की सम्मति से उन्हीं के बीच बैठकर विधि-विधान से उन्होंने उस सैकत लिंग की स्थापना कर दी। दक्षिणा-दान के लिए प्रभु ने कौस्तुभमणि को स्मरण किया। स्मरण करते ही वह मणि आकाश मार्ग से सूर्यवत आ पहुंची। प्रभु ने उसे गले में बांध लिया। उस मणि के प्रभाव से वहां धन, वस्त्र, गौएं, आभरण और पायसादि दिव्य अन्नों का ढेर लग गया। भगवान से अभिपूजित होकर ऋषिगण अपने घर चले। रास्ते में उन्हें हनुमानजी मिले। उन्होंने मुनियों से पूछा, “महाराज! आप लोगों की किसने पूजा की है?” 
उन्होंने कहा-“श्रीराघवेन्द्र ने शिवलिंग की प्रतिष्ठा की है, उन्होंने ही हमारी दक्षिणा-दान-मनादि से पूजा की है।” 
अब हनुमानजी को भगवान के मायावश क्रोध आया।
वे सोचने लगे-‘देखो! श्रीराम ने व्यर्थ का श्रम कराकर मेरे साथ यह कैसा व्यवहार किया है।’ दूसरे ही क्षण वे प्रभु के पास पहुंच गए और कहने लगे-“क्या लंका जाकर सीता का पता लगा आने का यही इनाम है ? यों काशी भेजकर लिंग मंगाकर मेरा उपहास किया जा रहा है ? यदि आपके मन में यही बात थी तो व्यर्थ का मेरे द्वारा श्रम क्यों कराया?” 
दयाधाम भगवान ने बड़ी शान्ति से कहा-“पवननन्दन ! तुम बिल्कुल ठीक ही तो कहते हो। तुम मेरे द्वारा स्थापित इस बालुकामय लिंग को उखाड़ डालो। मैं अभी तुम्हारे लाए लिंगों को स्थापित कर दूं।” 
‘बहुत ठीक’ कहकर अपनी पूंछ में लपेटकर हनुमानजी ने उस लिंग को बड़े जोर से खींचा।
पर आश्चर्य!
लिंग का उखड़ना या हिलना-डुलना तो दूर की बात रही, वह टस-से-मस तक न हुआ, उल्टे हनुमानजी की पूंछ ही टूट गई । वीरशिरोमणि हनुमानजी मूर्छित होकर पृथ्वी पर गिर पड़े। सब वानर जोर से हंस पड़े। स्वस्थ होने पर हनुमानजी सर्वथा गर्वविहीन हो गए। उन्होंने प्रभु के चरणों में नमस्कार किया और क्षमा मांगी। 
प्रभु को क्या था? क्षमा तो पहले ही दी हुई थी। भक्त का भयंकर रोग उत्पन्न होते-न-होते दूर कर दिया। तत्पश्चात विधिपूर्वक अपने स्थापित लिंग के उत्तर में विश्वनाथ-लिंग के नाम से उन्होंने हनुमानजी द्वारा लाए गए लिंगों की स्थापना कराई और वर दिया-“कोई यदि पहले हनुमत्प्रतिष्ठित विश्वनाथ-लिंग की अर्चना न कर मेरे द्वारा स्थापित रामेश्वर-लिंग की पूजा करेगा, तो उसकी पूजा व्यर्थ होगी।” 
 फिर प्रभु ने हनुमानजी से कहा-“तुम भी यहां छिन्न-पुच्छ, गुप्त-पाद-रूप से गतगर्व होकर निवास करो।” इस पर हनुमानजी ने अपनी एक वैसी ही छिन्न-पुच्छ, गुप्त-पाद, गतगर्व मद्रामयी प्रतिमा स्थापित कर दी। वह आज भी वहां वर्तमान है।'''
s25 = '''नारद की समस्या
एक बार देवर्षि नारद अपने पिता ब्रम्हा जी के सामने “नारायण-नारायण” का जप करते हुए उपस्थित हुए और पूज्य पिताजी को दंडवत प्रणाम किया ।  नारद जी को सामने देख ब्रम्हा जी ने पुछा, “नारद! आज कैसे आना हुआ ? तुम्हारे मुख के भाव कुछ कह रहे हैं! कोई विशेष प्रयोजन है अथवा कोई नई समस्या ?”
नारद जी ने उत्तर देते हुए कहा, “ पिताश्री ऐसा कोई विशेष प्रयोजन तो नहीं है, कई दिनों से एक प्रश्न मन में खटक रहा है । आज आपसे इसका उत्तर जानने के लिए उपस्थित हुआ हूँ । ”
“तो फिर विलम्ब कैसा? मन की शंकाओं का समाधान शीघ्रता से कर लेना ही ठीक रहता है! इसलिए निः संकोच अपना प्रश्न पूछो!”   – ब्रम्हाजी ने कहा ।
“पिताश्री आप सारे सृष्टि के परमपिता है, देवता और दानव आप की  ही संतान हैं । भक्ति और ज्ञान में देवता श्रेष्ठ हैं तो शक्ति तथा तपाचरण में दानव श्रेष्ठ हैं! परन्तु मैं इसी प्रश्न में उलझा हुआ हूँ कि इन दोनों में कौन अधिक श्रेष्ठ है। और आपने देवों को स्वर्ग और दानवों को पाताल लोक में जगह दी ऐसा क्यों? इन्हीं प्रश्नों का उत्तर जानने के लिए मैं आपकी शरण में आया हूँ” – नारद ने ब्रम्हाजी से अपना प्रश्न बताते हुए कहा ।
नारद का प्रश्न सुन ब्रम्हदेव बोले, नारद इस प्रश्न का उत्तर देना तो कठिन है और इसका उत्तर मैं नहीं दे पाऊँगा क्योंकि देव और दानव दोनों ही मेरे पुत्र हैं एवं अपने ही दो पुत्रों की तुलना अपने ही मुख से करना उचित नहीं होगा! लेकिन फिर भी तुम्हारे प्रश्न का उत्तर ढूंढने में मैं तुम्हारी सहायता कर सकता हूँ ।  तुम आज ही देवों और दानवों दोनों को मेरी और से भोजन का निमंत्रण भेजो ।  कल ही हम उनके लिए भोज का आयोजन करेंगे ।  और  कल ही तुम्हे तुम्हारे प्रश्न कि देव क्यों स्वर्ग-लोक में हैं तथा दानव पाताल-लोक में ; का उत्तर भी मिल जायेगा!
नारद तत्काल ही असुरों और देवों को निमंत्रण दे आये।
दुसरे दिन दानव ब्रम्ह-लोक में भोजन का आनंद लेने के लिए पहुँच गए और उन्होंने पहले पहुँचने के कारण भोजन की पहली शुरूआत खुद से करने के लिए ब्रम्हा जी से आग्रह किया ।
भोजन की थालियाँ परोसी गई, दानव भोजन करने के लिए बैठे, वे भोजन शुरू करने ही वाले थे कि ब्रम्हा जी हाथ में कुछ लकड़ियाँ लेकर उनके समक्ष उपस्थित हुए और उन्होंने कहा, “आज के भोजन की एक छोटी-सी शर्त है मैं यहाँ उपस्थित हर एक अतिथि के दोनों हाथों में इस प्रकार से लकड़ी बांधूंगा कि वो कोहनी से मुड़ नहीं पाए और इसी स्थिति में सभी को भोजन करना होगा । ”
कुछ देर बाद सभी असुरों के हाथों में लकड़ियाँ बंध चुकीं थीं। अब असुरों ने खाना शुरू किया , पर ऐसी स्थिति में कोई कैसे खा सकता था। कोई असुर सीधे थाली में मुँह डालकर खाने का प्रयास करने लगा तो कोई भोजन को हवा में उछालकर मुँह में डालने का प्रयत्न करने लगा ।  दानवों की ऐसी स्थिति देखकर नारद जी अपनी हंसी नहीं रोक पाए !
अपने सारे प्रयास विफल होते देख दानव बिना खाए ही उठ गए और क्रोधित होते हुए बोले, “हमारी यही दशा ही करनी थी तो हमें भोजन पर बुलाया ही क्यों? कुछ देर पश्चात् देव भी यहाँ पहुँचने वाले हैं ऐसी ही लकड़ियाँ आप उनके हाथों में भी बांधियेगा ताकि हम भी उनकी दुर्दशा का आनदं ले सकें…. ”
कुछ देर पश्चात् देव भी वहाँ पहुँच गए और अब देव भोजन के लिए बैठे, देवों के भोजन मंत्र पढ़ते ही ब्रम्हा जी ने सभी के हाथों में लकड़ियाँ बाँधी और भोजन की शर्त भी रखी ।
हाथों में लकड़ियाँ बंधने पर भी देव शांत रहे , वे समझ चुके थे कि खुद अपने हाथ से भोजन करना संभव नहीं है अतः वे थोड़ा आगे खिसक गए और थाली से अन्न उठा सामने वाले को खिलाकर भोजन आरम्भ किया । बड़े ही स्नेह के साथ वे एक दूसरे को खिला रहे थे, और भोजन का आनंद ले रहे थे, उन्होंने भोजन का भरपूर स्वाद लिया साथ ही दूसरों के प्रति अपना स्नेह, और सम्मान जाहिर किया ।
यह कल्पना हमे क्यों नहीं सूझी इसी विचार के साथ दानव बहुत दुखी होने लगे । नारद जी यह देखकर मुस्कुरा रहे थे । नारद जी ने ब्रम्हा जी से कहा, “पिताश्री  आपकी लीला अगाध है । युक्ति, शक्ति और सामर्थ्य का उपयोग स्वार्थ हेतु करने की अपेक्षा परमार्थ के लिए करने वाले का जीवन ही श्रेष्ठ होता है । दूसरों की भलाई में ही अपनी भलाई है यह आपने सप्रमाण दिखा दिया और मुझे अपने प्रश्नों का उत्तर मिल गया है ।  ब्रम्हा जी को सबने प्रणाम किया और वहाँ से विदा ली ।
मित्रों, हमें यह जीवन सिर्फ अपने ही स्वार्थ के लिए नहीं मिला है, यदि हम इसका उपयोग परोपकार के कार्यों के लिए करते हैं तो निश्चित रूप से हमें इसी जीवन में स्वर्ग की प्राप्ति होगी ।  '''
s26 = '''Once sage Narad went to visit Lord Ram.
He saw that Hanuman was guarding his palace.
Hanuman : “O sage, where are you going?”
Narad : “ I have come to see the Lord.” He then asked Hanuman, “ What is Lord doing now?”
Hanuman : “ I am not sure, but he is writing something in his notebook.”
Narad : “Really ? But what is he writing?”
Hanuman : “ I don't know that O sage. You can go and have a look. ”
Narad went inside and saw the Lord writing something.
Narad : “ O Lord, what are you doing with the pen and notebook? Why don't you give this work to a clerk?”
Ram : “No Narad, I have to do this work myself. I can't hand over this work to anyone.”
Narad : “Alright. But what kind of thing are you writing in your notebook?”
Ram : “What will you do by knowing ? Leave it.”
Narad : “No Lord, I am eager to know whatever you are writing.”
Ram : “In this notebook I take the attendance of those of my devotees who pray me all the time.”
Narad : “ I see ! Lord please show me where my name is.”
Lord showed him the notebook.
Narad was pleased to find his name on the top of the list and felt proud with the thought that the Lord believes him as his truest devotee.
But then he realised that Hanuman's name is nowhere to be seen in the notebook.
Narad started wondering that Hanuman is Lord Ram's faithful devotee,then why is his name not present in the notebook ! Did the Lord forget to write his name?
Puzzled Narad went to enquire Hanuman.
Narad : “Hanuman, the names of all the devotees are written in Lord's notebook, but I couldn't find your name there!
Hanuman : “O sage ! It must be there. Maybe you have overlooked.”
Narad : “ No no ! I checked it thoroughly,your name doesn't exist there.”
Hanuman : “ No problem, maybe I don't deserve to be in Lord's notebook. But Lord maintains a diary too,and even there he keeps writing something.”
Narad : “ Really ?”
Hanuman : “Yes !”
Narad went inside to meet the Lord again.
Narad : “ Lord, I have heard that you write a diary too. What do you write there?”
Ram : “ Yes, but that's none of your use.”
Narad : “ Lord please tell me, I am curious to know what you write there.”
Ram : (smiles) “ O sage, here I write the names of those devotees who I always pray.”
Narad opened the diary and found Hanuman's name on the top.
Narad's pride vanished instantly seeing that.'''
s27 = '''Before the Mahabharat war began, Lord Krishna asked all the warriors how many days it would take them to finish the war alone. Bhisma replied it would take him 20 days. Dronacharya said he would take 25 days. Karna said it would take him 24 days and Arjuna said it would take him 28 days. But Barbarik astonished Krishna with his answer. He said it would take him 1 minute to win the battle by himself.
Barbarik was the son of Ghatotkach and the grandson of Bheem
Pleased with his tapasya (meditation), Lord Shiva awarded him with 3 powerful arrows:
1. The first arrow would mark his enemy with red ink
2. The second arrow would mark the things that he wanted to save
3. The third arrow would destroy enemy target marked with red ink in the first step or destroy everything not marked in step 2.
And at the end of this all the arrows would come return to the quiver.'''
s28 = '''The story of Lord Parshuram
Lord Vishnu is known for his many incarnations. Parshuram is believed to be his sixth incarnation.The story of Parshuram belongs to the Treta yug. The word Parshuram means Lord Ram with an axe.
Parshuram was the son of Jamadagni and Renuka. Parshuram had received an axe from Lord Shiva after undertaking terrible reparation. Lord Shiva had also taught his methods of warfare and other skills. Born in a Brahmin family, he was unlike the other Brahmins. Instead, Parshuram carried traits of a Kshatriya. He carried a number of Khatriya traits, which included aggression, warfare and valour. Hence, he is called as a ‘Brahma-Kshatriya’ as he had skills from both the clan.Once King Kartavirya Sahasrarjuna and his army forcibly tried to take away Parshuram’s father’s magical cow named Kamdhenu.
Being angry and revengeful, he killed the entire army and King Kartavirya. In revenge for their father’s death, the king's son killed Jamadagni in Parshuram’s absence. Furious and hurt by their act, he went ahead killing all the king’s sons and corrupt Haihaya Kings and warriors on the earth.He conducted the Ashvamedha sacrifice and gave away his entire holdings to the priests who conducted the ritual.Parshuram is also known as immortal, who fought back the advancing ocean, which was going to hit the lands of Kokan and Malabar. The area between Maharashtra and Karnataka is known as ParshuramKshetra.
Parshuram was known for his love for righteousness. He was known to be the Guru to Bhishma, Dronacharya and Karna. However, in advance, Parshuram knew that Karna would do injustice to Duryodhan in the Kruskshetra war. So as the duty of a good guru, he decides to teach him the Brahmashastra, but he also cursed Karna that the knowledge will not be any useful to him.
According to the folklore, Parshuram gave the Sudharshan chakra to Lord Krishna. It is believed that the main motto of Vishnu’s sixth incarnation was to free the earth’s burden by assassinating the sinful and irreligious kings who neglected their duties.
There are many such stories related to Lord Parshuram. His battle with Bhishma Pitamah is one of the most fierce battle fought.'''
s29 = '''The Crown For Roosters
According to Odiya tales, Rama starts crying when he can’t find Sita but a rooster approaches him and tells him that his wife hasn’t run away because of a tough forest life but has been abducted by the evil Ravana
The rooster remarks that greedy men already chase him to eat him and he doesn’t want them coming after him for gold. Lord Rama instead gives the rooster a crown of skin. That’s why the roosters have a crown.'''
s30 = '''The Story of King Shibi
King Shibi was known for his truthfulness, being just, and keeping his word. The gods Agni and Indra decided to test these qualities. They assumed the forms of a dove and a hawk, the latter pursuing the former. The dove sought protection with Shibi, who promised to save him. The hawk in anger accused him of depriving him of his rightful food. The king, in reply, offered flesh from his own body to appease his hunger. The hawk asked for flesh equal to the weight of the dove. A balance was brought, and the king started cutting flesh from his body, but the dove seemed to be getting heavier with every piece. Finally, the king himself sat in the balance offering his entire body. At this, the gods came into their real forms granting him many boons and the gods above, a witness to this test, showered him with flowers and praise'''
s31 = '''The Birth of Satyavati
Most people know Satyavati, the second wife of King Shantanu, as the daughter of a fisherman. But her real father is a king by name Uparichara.
One day, when he is away on an expedition to hunt deer, he finds himself consumed by desire for his wife, Girika, whom he has left behind at the palace.
He produces his seed and gives it to a passing hawk to carry to his wife so that she could impregnate herself.
The hawk, on its way to the palace, gets into a fight with another hawk, and in the process, drops the king’s seed into the Yamuna, where it is swallowed by a fish.
Now this fish is really an Apsara called Adrika, who has been transformed by a sage’s curse. When she swallows Uparichara’s seed, she becomes pregnant, and in due course, the spirit of Adrika leaves the animal.
While the fish is heavily pregnant, some of the king’s fishermen catch it and bring it into the royal kitchen. They cut it open for Uparichara’s feast, only to find that a boy and a girl come out of it.
The king keeps the boy at his court, but gives the girl away to the fishermen to foster in their settlement. Since she came out of a fish, the girl carries the foul odour on her person, and she is given the name Matsyagandhi.
In due course, after she arrives at the court of Hastinapur as queen, they call her Satyavati.'''
s32 = '''The Unused Weapon: Pashupatastra
The Pashupatastra is often described as the one weapon that can destroy all of Brahma’s creation if not used by the right warrior against the right enemy.
The story of how Arjuna obtains the weapon is also one in which his arrogance is crushed by Shiva.
During their exile, Arjuna performs some austerities for Lord Shiva in the hope of pleasing him, when a demon called Noorkasura dons the shape of a wild boar and charges at him.
Arjuna awakens from his trance, and finds just enough time to reach for his bow and shoot one arrow at the advancing beast.
But when the animal falls to the ground, sticking out of his side are two arrows, one his, lined with white feathers of a dove, and the other a strange, crude, blunt shaft.
Arjuna springs to his feet and runs across the barren land to claim his kill, but at the same time a hunter leaps out of the bushes, and reaches the carcass of the boar before he does, pinning it down with his blackened foot.
‘This is mine,’ says the stranger. ‘You have encroached upon my neck of the woods. All the beasts that come into this area have to fall by my arrows.’
Arjuna smirks at the arrogance of the hunter. ‘I am the son of Indra. I am your king, your protector, and you speak to me thus.’
‘I can tell that you are the son of Indra,’ says the hunter. ‘Your eyes carry the same unearned pride that I have seen in his.’Words flow from one to the other and back. Tired by the unending volley, Arjuna steps up and challenges the hunter for a duel.
The hunter stands tall, hands on hips, and says, ‘Let us see how good your aim is, prince of Hastinapur.’
Arjuna strings and arrow, takes aim, and lets it fly. It whizzes past the hunter and strikes the trunk of a tree. Another arrow, and this one too misses its mark.
In exasperation, Arjuna looks at the Gandiva, then at the hunter, and runs up to his enemy. He leaps into the air to strike the hunter full on the forehead.
But the bow in his hands has changed into a garland of jasmines, and it has left him and fallen around the hunter’s neck.
Now when Arjuna looks up he sees the three sharp tips of a sturdily held trident, and the shiny coat of leopard skin wrapped around the waist.
Realization strikes him, and he falls to his knees. Lord Shiva blesses him, cautions him against conceit, and grants him the Pashupatastra.'''
s33 = '''The Blinding of Shukracharya
Bali, the emperor of the Asuras, once becomes so powerful that he is able to conquer all the three worlds and drive the gods away from heaven.
To celebrate his victory over all of creation, the emperor calls for a feast in which he gives away alms to the poor.
Shukracharya the preceptor is right by Bali’s side, guiding him through the rites.
The Gods go to Vishnu for help, and in a bid to bring back what had been taken from them, Vishnu dons the shape of Vaman, the boy Brahmin, and arrives at Bali’s hermitage.
Upon his arrival, the hall falls silent, and Shukracharya immediately divines that this is no ordinary boy. He leans toward Bali and whispers that he must not yield to the boy’s words.
To this Bali replies, ‘If the Lord himself has come to ask me for something, how can I say no?’
Vaman walks up to the pulpit, where ghee is being poured off deep wooden spoons into the fire. He comes up to the king and asks if he could be granted three wishes.
Any number of wishes for you, my lord,’ says Bali.
‘Three is all I ask, O king.’
Bali joins his hands and bows.
‘Three feet of land is all I ask, Your Majesty. I am but a Brahmin. What need have I for treasures and gold?’
Shukracharya whispers softly to Bali that he must not accede. But Bali gets up to his feet and readies the vessel of holy water. The preceptor shrinks himself down to the size of a gnat so that he could block the spout of the kettle.
Then Vaman pokes at the spout with a blade of grass to unblock it, and blinds Shukracharya in one eye.
After the alms have been given, Vaman swells up to become a giant. With one foot he measures all of Earth and the underworld. With his second foot he measures out all of heaven. Then he asks Bali, ‘Where shall I place my third foot?’
To which Bali, realizing that he has been outwitted, says, ‘Here, Lord Vishnu, on my head.’'''
s34 = '''Anasuya, the Mother of the Trinity
Anasuya, often called ‘Sati Anasuya’, was the wife of Atri, one of the Seven Great Sages.
Together, they lived in a hermitage near the Southern border of the forest of Chitrakoota, where Rama, Sita and Lakshmana arrive while on exile in the Ramayana.
One tale illustrating Anasuya’s qualities as a chaste wife is mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana, when Sage Narada praises Anasuya in hymns and verses, sending Lakshmi, Parvati and Saraswati into a fit of envy.
‘Who is this Anasuya?’ they ask one another. ‘Can this Anasuya be a more suitable wife than us, the wives of the Holy Trinity?’
They request their husbands to test Anasuya’s chastity, in response to which the three gods descend to Atri’s hermitage in his absence and asks her to serve them food in the nude.
Anasuya smiles her agreement, but first sprinkles holy water on the three of them to convert them into children. It is said in some versions that Anasuya then proceeds to feed them milk off her own breasts.
When Atri returns to the cottage, the three children merge into a single being with two legs, one trunk, three heads and six hands. The boy comes to be known as Dattatreya, worshipped around India as an avatar of the trinity.'''
s35 = '''Ashtavakra
In the Mahabharata, the story of Ashtavakra is told in the Vana Parva. He is the son of Kahola and Sujata, disciple and daughter respectively of Sage Uddalaka.
When Sujata becomes pregnant, she makes a habit of attending the Vedic discourses in which her husband and father participate.
As her stomach grows in size, the embryo becomes more and more able to grasp the words that are being spoken, and near the seventh month or so, begins to correct the inaccuracies in verses uttered by Kahola.
This happens on eight separate occasions, which results in Kahola cursing his own son with eight deformities in the body.
Thus is born Ashtavakra, with deformities in feet, knees, hands, the chest and the head. Around the time of his birth, Kahola goes to Janaka’s palace and loses a debate with the palace sage named Vandin.
As punishment for the loss, Kahola is put to death by immersion in a lake.
When he is twelve, Ashtavakra comes to know from Sujata and Uddalaka about his real parentage, and resolves to defeat Vandin at Janaka’s court. After a long and protracted debate, Vandin gets defeated and is thrown into the water himself.
But Vandin reveals that he is the incarnation of Varuna, the god of water, and frees all the other sages that have been immersed due to defeat in past debates.
Then, on Kahola’s suggestion, Ashtavakra takes a dip in the river Samanga, which straightens all his crooked limbs and organs.'''
s36 = '''The Non-human Races: Kinnaras and Kimpurushas
Some earth-bound races in the Mahabharata are described as half-human, half-animal. Of these, kinnaras and kimpurushas are often invoked.
The names of both races are designed as questions (kin-nara, kim-purusha) which mean: Is it human?
Male kinnaras are said to be half-horse, like the Greek centaurs. In the Mahabharata, their characters are described as loving and given to pleasure.
They often appear in pairs, one kinnara with one kinnari, and they see themselves as eternal, monogamous lovers. They have no children, and they permit no third creature to disrupt their pairing.
The Kinnari is often described as half woman, half-bird, renowned for her dance, song and poetry. The Kinnari is thought to be a traditional symbol for feminine beauty, grace and accomplishment.The Kimpurushas are more violent beings. They have kingdoms, and there is history of conflict between them and the Kshatriyas. They are described as half-men, half-lions in the Mahabharata.
Though the exact locations of these races and their kingdoms are little known, references in the Mahabharata suggest that they have lived beyond the ‘White Mountains’, which could mean the present-day Himalayas'''
s37 = '''Non-human Races: Yakshas and Gandharvas
Among other non-human races that make constant guest appearances are Yakshas and Gandharvas.
The most famous Yaksha in the Mahabharata is the one who appears as a guardian of a lake in the forest where the Pandavas rest during their exile.
He asks Yudhishthir a bunch of questions that have come to be known as ‘Yaksha-prashna’ – or ‘the Yaksha’s questions’.
The Yakshas are typically thought to be benevolent nature-spirits, caring for trees, rivers, lakes and such. They live in roots and hollows. Many of them have a dual nature: one on hand they are benign and generous, but on the other they can be cruel.
The female of the species – called Yakshinis – are portrayed as beautiful young women with full breasts and hips.
The Gandharvas are also nature spirits, but they are elevated to the status of semi-divine beings. They’re said to be the guardians of the divine nectar of the gods. They’re the husbands of Apsaras, and possess exceptional musical talents.
In a lot of art and sculpture, Gandharvas are shown in the middle of a recital in the court of Indra, while an Apsara dances to their tunes and song.
Their form of marriage is not composed of the rituals and rites of a Hindu marriage.Many human characters in the Mahabharata (e.g. Shakuntala and Dushyanta) marry their spouses according to the Gandharva code, which is consummated by mutual consent in the absence of witnesses.'''
s38 = '''Maya the Gifted Architect
Mayasura is a king of the race of demons (Asura, Rakshasa and Daitya). His great ability is the art of architecture. It is said that he once ruled over a kingdom called Mayarashtra.
A master of illusion and a magician with materials, Maya makes an appearance in both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
In the former, he is introduced as the father of Mandodari, the wife of Ravana. He is said to be one of the many sons of Diti and Kashyapa, and he may have had more than a passing hand in the construction of Lanka.
His role in the Mahabharata is less connected to the main events but no less important.After the destruction of the Khandava forest, in which Krishna and Arjuna protect the life of Maya, the architect is employed to build for Yudhishthir a great hall in the city of Indraprastha.
In another story told in the Shiva Purana, Maya is described as the builder of Tripura – which means ‘three cities’. The first exists on earth, built with iron walls.
The second hangs in the sky, with walls built of silver, while the third is located in heaven, fortified by walls of gold.The demons get a boon from Brahma that all three cities must be destroyed by a single arrow, safe in the knowledge that such a powerful arrow could only be shot by Shiva, their chief patron god.Also, Maya builds Tripura in such a manner that the three cities never fall into a single line, save for a few moments in a thousand years, when the star ‘Pushya’ comes into conjunction with the moon.
After the construction of Tripura, demons from all around the three worlds come to the city and begin to live there. Over a period of time, they begin to threaten the gods.
Then, to restore order, Shiva enters the fray and shoots an arrow at the right moment that reduces Tripura to dust.
It is said that Meru itself becomes the bow, Adisesha the string and Vishnu the arrow. Agni sits on the tip of the shaft, while Vayu gives wing to its feathers.
This act of annihilating the city of Tripura gives Shiva the title of Tripurantaka (‘the ender of Tripura’).'''
s39 = '''The Apsaras: Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka, Tilottama
In the Mahabharata, the Apsaras are one of the ‘other races’ who are divine dancers in the court of Indra.
They are wives of Gandharvas, and are often depicted as nubile young women who perform tasks of seduction on human beings upon orders from one of the gods.
There are four main apsaras that make frequent appearances in various myths. We will look at each of them in turn.'''
s40 = '''Rambha
Perhaps the best-known of all the apsaras, very little is known of the life of Rambha. She is unrivalled in the arts of dancing, music and lovemaking.
When she tries to distract Vishwamitra from his penance during his quest to become the Brahmarshi, he curses her to become a stone.In the Ramayana, Ravana violates Rambha and earns a curse from Brahma that if he ever takes another woman against her will, his head would explode. This protects Sita’s chastity during her stay in the Ashokavana.'''
s41 = '''Urvashi
Urvashi is considered the most beautiful of the Apsaras, though the rest of them would disagree.
Her birth is said to have happened when the twin sages Nara-narayana clapped their thighs in anger in response to Indra’s sending down of Menaka and Rambha to foil their prayers.
They named her ‘Urvashi’ (born of the thigh) and gifted her to Indra after the incident. Urvashi is best known in a legend of love with King Pururava, with whom she has a son named Ayu.
Urvashi is cursed to bear Pururava his child, but also to leave them once their son is born.'''
s42 = '''Menaka
Menaka’s story is most closely entwined with that of the mainstream Mahabharata. She is sent by Indra to Vishwamitra to break the severe penances he is undertaking in a bid to become a Brahmarshi.
Menaka succeeds in seducing the sage, and they have a daughter together, whom they name Shakuntala.
The girl grows up in the hermitage of Sage Kanva, and later marries Dushyanta and gives birth to Bharata.
When Vishwamitra realizes his folly, he sends Menaka away and requests her never to meet him again.'''
s43 = '''Tilottama
The Mahabharata describes Tilottama as being created by the divine architect, Vishwakarma.In the Adi Parva, Narada tells the Pandavas the story of Sunda and Upasunda, inseparable brothers who show signs of power strong enough to challenge the gods.
They have a boon that they would be indestructible by all enemies save for each other. Brahma then orders Vishwakarma to create a beautiful woman who incites envy between the two brothers to the point that they kill one another.
Narada gives this tale as an example that Draupadi could indeed become a reason for quarrel among the Pandavas. He urges them to adopt a system whereby they could ‘share’ her amicably.'''
s44 = '''The Seven Chiranjeevis
The chiranjeevis are immortal beings in Indian mythology that are believed to remain alive on Earth until the end of Kali Yuga.
There are seven chiranjeevis in all.
1.      Ashwatthama, son of Drona. A great warrior and the son of a sage. He is considered to be a Maharathi in his skill with weapons, but also a scholar and a wise man.Immortality comes his way as a curse for his attempt to destroy the fetus in Uttara’s womb at the end of the Mahabharata war.
2.      Bali, the demon king. After facing defeat in the hands of the boy Brahmin Vaman, Bali, the king of the demons is granted the gift of immortality.
3.      Hanuman, the loyal vanara. Hanuman is the aide that helps Rama recover Sita from the clutches of Ravana. After the events of the Ramayana, Hanuman is thought to have retreated into the mountains to lose himself in prayer.
4.      Kripacharya, the teacher of the Kuru princes. Before the arrival of Drona, Kripa is assigned the task of training the Kuru princes.
He is one of the survivors of the Mahabharata war, and afterwards he is appointed as a preceptor to Parikshit, Arjuna’s grandson and the father of Janamejaya.
5.      Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. This is probably the only immortal avatar of Vishnu. Though milked dry of all his powers by now, Parashurama is expected to return at the end of the epoch and guide Kalki in his efforts to save mankind.
6.      Vibhishana, brother of Rama. After the Ramayana war is won (or lost, depending on how you look at it), Vibhishana is crowned the king of Lanka by Rama, and is given a boon that he shall be alive on Earth until the end of the Mahayuga.
7.      Vyasa. He is the sage who composed the Mahabharata. He is said to have taken birth in the Tretayuga, lived to see the end of Dwapara, and will not meet his death until the end of Kali.'''
s45 = '''Trishanku
This is a story of the ambition of two men.
Trishanku, who was born King Satyavrata into the Solar Dynasty, is filled with the desire of ascending to heaven in his mortal form.
He approaches Vasishtha with his request first, and the sage rejects him. ‘Spend the rest of your life doing good, O King,’ says Vasishtha, ‘for that is the only way to reach heaven.’
However, Satyavrata does not accept this answer, and tries to induce Shakti, Vasishtha’s son, into performing this task for him. When Vasishtha comes to know of this, he curses Satyavrata with the appearance of a chandala.
Satyavrata changes his name to Trishanku.
Around this time, Vishwamitra, a king who had been slighted by Vasishtha, has just been conferred the title of Rajarshi. His great ambition, though, is to become a Brahmarshi and be respected on equal terms as Vasishtha.
When Trishanku approaches Vishwamitra, therefore, the sage agrees to send him to heaven in his mortal body. ‘If I perform a feat that sage Vasishtha did not,’ he thinks, ‘I will be thought of as greater than he.’
So a sacrificial fire is built, a hermitage is elected for the ritual. Vishwamitra presides over all offerings and prayers, and with his yogic powers, lifts Trishanku off the ground into the sky, sending him hurtling toward the stars.
But when the king reaches the gates of heaven the gatekeepers seize him by the legs and throw him back down to Earth. During his head-first descent, Trishanku prays to Vishwamitra for help.
In his anger, Vishwamitra says, ‘If the Gods will not allow you into their heaven, Trishanku, I shall build a heaven for you right where you are.’
He extends his arm to stall the fall of the king, and around him spring up – by the power of the sage – a whole constellation of stars and other heavenly bodies.
The gods of heaven, then, approach Vishwamitra and convince him to reduce the powers of Trishanku so that his rule will still be superseded by that of Indra.
Vishwamitra agrees, and ever since then, Trishanku has been ruling his heaven, even though he is yet to be granted passage into the real abode of the Gods.'''
s46 = '''Kartikeya,
Kartikeya is an important god in the Hindu pantheon, and he bears the title of ‘Deva Senapati’, or ‘the General of the gods’.
In the Mahabharata, he is described as being the son of Agni and Svaha, and the reason for his birth is to destroy a buffalo demon by name Mahishasura.
It is in the Shiva Purana that Kartikeya takes birth as the son of Siva and Parvati. The Devas are then under onslaught by an Asura called Soorapadam, who has a boon that he can be killed by only Lord Shiva or his seed.
The gods run to Lord Shiva for help, and in order to vanquish the enemy, Shiva opens his third eye, whence six sparks come out.
Agni, the god of fire, takes these six sparks to Saravana Lake where, on the petals of a lotus, Kartikeya takes birth with six heads.
Shiva and Parvati give him over for fostering with the six Krittika sisters, who bring him up to be a handsome, intelligent and powerful man.
It is with this association with the Krittikas that he gains the name of Kartikeya.'''
s47 = '''HOW MANTHARA (GOONI OF RAMAYANA) WAS BORN
The ten-headed Ravana became all-powerful due to the boon he received from Brahma. The gods rushed to Brahma and sought relief from the demon. Brahma told them that only the Supreme god, Vishnu, could slay Ravana. Accordingly Vishnu was born to Dasaratha as Rama, and Sakra was sent to earth to beget monkeys and bears to help him. All the other gods were asked to choose their roles in the drama to be played. Brahma asked a Gandharvi (demi-god), Dundhubi by name, to be born as Manthara. Her mission? To create confusion and trouble. Her success? Rama's coronation was cancelled and he was sent to the forest for fourteen years.'''
s48 = '''THE BIRTH OF DEATH
Brahma first created all that was found in the universe – mobile and immobile. He, however, found that once created, he had no control over these objects. Wrath filled him as he realized that none of his creation could be destroyed. In anger, he let go a terrible fire which raged over the universe, destroying everything that came its way. The fire blazed for eons, until Lord Siva became concerned. He appeared before Brahma and counselled him to cool his anger. After much persuasion Brahma regained his composure. He then created from his own body, a maiden who was dark, with red eyes and red tongue, wearing diverse ornaments. Brahma called her Death and ordered her to go to the universe and slay all the creatures that he had created. But Death, being a lady, became sad at having to deprive creatures of their lives, for she thought that she could cause much sorrow by her action. Her prayer to Brahma, not to be given this task, went unheard. She therefore performed a severe penance which lasted many billion years. At last Brahma appeared before her and asked what she wanted. Death again requested that she should be excused from causing the end of all creatures. Brahma told her, “I am pleased with your penance. But the work I have given you has to be done. I understand your feelings. But you need not experience any sorrow as I ordain that creatures would bring their own death. You will be assisted by Yama. Disease, fights and natural calamities would cause creatures to die by themselves. It would be realized that whatever is born, has to die. There could be no escape from death.” This assuaged Death’s feelings and she has set about her task faithfully ever since.'''
s49 = '''THE FARMER AND THE TIGER
In a forest near his village a farmer was grazing his cow. A tiger suddenly appeared in the scene. The farmer sat down and started to cry. The tiger was puzzled at the farmer’s behavior. Out of curiosity he asked the farmer what was the reason for his grief. The farmer told the tiger, “O lord of the jungle. I have a beautiful and highly accomplished daughter. It is time to get her married. I have been searching everywhere but could not find a match for her.” The tiger asked the farmer, “What kind of a boy are you looking for?” The farmer replied, “He should be handsome, strong and intelligent. In fact he should be someone like you.” “Why then,” the tiger said. “I can marry her myself.” “That is precisely what I was thinking,” the farmer said.” But you and I belong to different species. Even if I am agreeable, my kith and kin might oppose the idea. I shall therefore go to the village and consult my friends and relatives whether they would accept your proposal.” The farmer left the tiger and returned after some time. “O noble tiger,” he said. “My kinsmen are delighted at the prospect of having you as a 'groom. I am however yet to ask my daughter.” The tiger bade the farmer to go post haste to his daughter and get her consent. The farmer disappeared for a short while. When he reappeared, he had a worried look on his face. He told the tiger, “O King among animals, my daughter is agreeable but she is afraid of your claws and teeth. They should not injure her while you lovingly embrace her.” It was then agreed that the tiger would make himself less dangerous. The farmer went to the village and this time fetched a carpenter. The carpenter chiseled the claws and teeth of the tiger. The next moment the farmer took a stick and showered a few blows on the tiger. The beast who had lost his teeth and claws had to run away to save himself'''
s50 = '''HOW INDRA GOT HIS VAJRA (THUNDERBOLT)
The Kalakeyas, a tribe of demons, along with Vritra, fought against Indra and defeated him. Indra, followed by all the gods who were under his protection, went to Brahma for help and advice. Brahma told them to seek the sage Dadachi on the banks of the River Saraswati. The sage was performing a severe penance but willingly helped Indra. From out of his body he removed all the bones and handed them to Indra. With those bones a mighty six-edged weapon was made called the Vajra. When released, the weapon would make a thunderous noise and destroy the most powerful enemy. Indra used this weapon to destroy Vritra. He retained the weapon after his victory'''
s51 = '''Sahadeva – The astrologer
Sahadeva (the youngest Pandava) was an excellent astrologer. He knew everything about the future. He knew that a war was going to occur, but he kept silent because he was under a curse that if he revealed anything to anybody he would die. There is also a story of him being a great astrologer. Pandu (Father of Pandavas) wished his sons must eat his flesh post death so that all the knowledge may transfer to them which he had collected after so many years. Only Sahadeva ate a piece; the moment he ate, he was able to see future but stopped by God.'''
s52 = '''Arjuna –the eunuch
Arjuna was really a eunuch during the agyaatvaas. He was known as Brihannala. This was due to a curse from Urvashi. In Indralok, Arjun was propositioned by Urvashi, but he used to address her as ‘mother’ as she had was married to his ancestor, Pururva. Annoyed with Arjun’s rejection, Urvashi cursed him to become a eunuch. Arjuna used this curse to his advantage during the agyaatvaas.
When lord Indra came to know about the curse, he told Arjun that this curse is going to serve as a boon during the one year stay in hiding and after spending that period, he would regain his masculinity. This proved to be true  in Agyaatvaas. After spending twelve years in forest, Pandavas spent the 13th year of exile in cognito, in the court of King Virat.  Arjuna used his curse and lived as a eunuch named Brihannala and remain undetected as required by the condition of anonymity.
Arjuna defeated the Kauravas after the agyaatvaas, which included Drona, Karna and Bhishma. Uttar was his charioteer.'''
s53 = '''Drona and Drupada
Drona was born in a vessel. He was sage Bhardwaj’s son. On a river side, Bharadwaj saw an apsara named Ghritachi. He was filled with desire and his seed fell into a pot or basket. Inside it, a baby boy developed who was named Drona as he was born in a pot.
Drupada was a friend of Drona. But he did not treat Drona well because of his poorness. Drona asked Panadavas to gift him the kingdom of Drupada as Gurudakshina. Pandavas defeated and imprisoned Drupada for Drona.
Drupada desired a son who could kill Drona who had humiliated him in battle and taken half his kingdom. He was rewarded with a son and a daughter. Dhrishtdyumna was his son who eventually killed Drona in Mahabharata war. His daughter was Draupadi, who became the wife of Pandavas. Ashwaththama killed Dhristdyumna, Shikhandi and sons of Pandavas with help of Kritvarma and Kripacharya on the last night of Mahabharata war.'''
s54 = '''Gandhari
Gandhari was married to Dhritrashtra, who was a blind. Since her husband was blind, she also decided to remain as a blind, by tying a cloth over her eyes. This was equivalent to a penance, which gave her powers that if she sees someone, he will become impregnable.
To use her power to make Duryodhana invincible, she asked him to come to her naked. Duryodhana duly came and his body became impregnable, save for his thighs, where, he, on advice of Shri Krishna, wore a loin cloth. Bhima could only kill Duryodhana because of stroke of the genius, Shri Krishna. 
Kauravas had one sister. Her name was Dushala. She was later married to Jayadratha, who was killed by Arjuna to revenge the death of his son, Abhimanyu.
Draupadi kept her hair untied after the cheerharan. She vowed that she will tie her hair with Dushashana’s blood. Bheem did the needful.'''
